	KERNEL REQUIREMENTS

You need a kernel with ip_gre patched to support setting and getting
of NBMA address. This is available in vanilla kernel since 2.6.24-rc2.
Also it is present in Gentoo patches: gentoo-sources-2.6.23-r1 and
gentoo-sources-2.6.22-r10 have it.

Also remember to turn on CONFIG_ARPD and CONFIG_NET_IPGRE in your kernel
configuration.

	COMPILING

Just type 'make' and 'make install'.

	CONFIGURATION

OpenNHRP currently supports only IPv4 over IPv4 using NBMA GRE tunnels.
To create NBMA GRE tunnel you might use following:

	ip tunnel add gre1 mode gre key 1234 ttl 64
	ip addr add 10.255.255.2/24 dev gre1
	ip link set gre1 up
	
This should work with the configuration example in opennhrp.conf(5).

	DOCUMENTATION

Most of the OpenNHRP documentation is in the manpages. Read them.

Also some general NHRP documents can be found from Cisco pages
(www.cisco.com).

	BUGS

Use the SourceForge bug tracker.
