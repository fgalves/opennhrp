OpenNHRP Release Notes
======================

OpenNHRP is an NHRP implementation for Linux. It has most of the RFC2332
and Cisco IOS extensions.

	KERNEL REQUIREMENTS

You need a kernel with ip_gre patched to support sending and receiving
using NBMA address. 

The support was originally added to 2.6.24-rc2, but it contains a bug
that prevents NAT detection. The latest fixes will be present in
2.6.24-rc7.

Gentoo kernels: gentoo-sources-2.6.23-r1 and gentoo-sources-2.6.22-r10
have the partitial support too (no NAT there either).

Also remember to turn on CONFIG_ARPD and CONFIG_NET_IPGRE in your kernel
configuration.

	COMPILING

Just type 'make' and 'make install'.

	CONFIGURATION

OpenNHRP currently supports only IPv4 over IPv4 using NBMA GRE tunnels.
To create NBMA GRE tunnel you might use following:

	ip tunnel add gre1 mode gre key 1234 ttl 64
	ip addr add 10.255.255.2/24 dev gre1
	ip link set gre1 up
	
This should work with the configuration example in opennhrp.conf(5).

	IPSEC ENCRYPTION OF GRE PACKETS

To be documented when ipsec-tools is properly patched.

	DOCUMENTATION

Most of the OpenNHRP documentation is in the manpages. Read them.

Also some general NHRP documents can be found from Cisco pages
(www.cisco.com).

	BUGS

Use the SourceForge bug tracker.
