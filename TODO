Open items that need work on OpenNHRP:

- config directive to specify the shortcut subnet in addition / instead
  of the automatic route detection and interface specifications

- Proper handling of unique bit. Currently registration of unique address
  overwrites previous registration, but this against RFC.

- Load balancing: return multiple CIE entries, when we have multiple
  local IP addresses. When receiving multi CIE next-hop, balance traffic
  or for shortcut routes, create a multi nexthop route.

- Create some logic to detect if NBMA and public IPs are mixed up in
  the "map" directive. Issue on warning about this.

- Support reloading of configuration (via SIGHUP or "opennhrpctl reload")

- Clean shutdown: send purge request to registration servers, dynamic
  clients and possibly track resolution requests and purge those too.
