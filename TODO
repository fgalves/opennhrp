Open items that need work on OpenNHRP:
  
- "dns-map" directive, to map multiple GRE IP:s based on DNS;
   e.g. "dns-map 172.16.0.1/16 core.foo.example register" or similar
     would automatically do:
       map 172.16.0.1/16 a.core.foo.example register
       map 172.16.0.2/16 b.core.foo.example register
       ...
   for all existing DNS entries. This would make adding a new global
   hub node very simple.

- Proper handling of unique bit. Currently registration of unique address
  overwrites previous registration, but this against RFC.

- Load balancing: return multiple CIE entries, when we have multiple
  local IP addresses. When receiving multi CIE next-hop, balance traffic
  or for shortcut routes, create a multi nexthop route.

- Create some logic to detect if NBMA and public IPs are mixed up in
  the "map" directive. Issue on warning about this.

- Recheck the NHRP packet routing logic. It looks like a packet originator
  is not checked when making new routing decision. This can lead an packet
  to return to sender. Especially if there is a BGP routing loop. In such
  situations the packet should be dropped.

- Do to the above bug, shortcut might be created based on a local route.
  Thus opennhrp might replace a local, administrative route. Make sure
  local routes are never ever replaced.

- Support reloading of configuration (via SIGHUP or "opennhrpctl reload")

- Clean shutdown: send purge request to registration servers, dynamic
  clients and possibly track resolution requests and purge those too.
