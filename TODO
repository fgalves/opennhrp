Open items that need work on OpenNHRP:

- config directive to specify the shortcut subnet in addition / instead
  of the automatic route detection and interface specifications

- processing of registration script is currently synchronous; it
  could cause bad things to happen if too many registration requests
  got queued (e.g. timers/signals not handled properly). fix the
  registration script hook to be asynchronous. this implies having
  a list of pending registration requests.

- Limit the amount of simultanous opennhrp-script spawns. There are
  situations where a script storm arises: e.g. hub node is rebooted and all
  leafs try to connect about the same time.
  
- "dns-map" directive, to map multiple GRE IP:s based on DNS
   e.g. "dns-map N 172.16.0.0/16 core.foo.example register" or similar
     would automatically get A records for core.foo.example, and
     connect to N of them. the actual private IP of a public IP could
     be figured out using opennhrp-script, and parse IPsec certificate,
     or get corresponding TXT records

- Proper handling of unique bit. Currently registration of unique address
  overwrites previous registration, but this against RFC.

- Load balancing: return multiple CIE entries, when we have multiple
  local IP addresses. When receiving multi CIE next-hop, balance traffic
  or for shortcut routes, create a multi nexthop route.

- Create some logic to detect if NBMA and public IPs are mixed up in
  the "map" directive. Issue on warning about this.

- Support reloading of configuration (via SIGHUP or "opennhrpctl reload")

- Clean shutdown: send purge request to registration servers, dynamic
  clients and possibly track resolution requests and purge those too.
